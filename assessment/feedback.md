## 0. Practicals and Exercises  
  
The practicals folder contains the work from each week that I have completed. In each folder there is a copy of the slides from the video, this is a PDF file that has been annotated on by myself with handwritten notes.   
There is also 2 Microsoft Word documents, the exercises and practicals documents. These have all been completed and uploaded. The associated Python files in these folders relate directly to the exercises and practical documents.   
  
## 1. Task 1: Pizza Prices  
  
The Pizza program is working as described in the brief. It works by taking user input for required data and calculating a final price using a selection of IF statements.   
Data validation is performed during the input phase by using a While loop, correct data being entered will delete the 'TRUE' value, breaking the loop and allowing the program to continue.   
From my testing, there are no bugs or errors and the program is complete.   
  
## 2. Task 2: The Cat Shelter  
  
This program works correctly. The program calculated the data with the cat_shelter.py program, this is a function called upon by the cat_shelter_program.py file.   
The function works by opening the log file and reading each line individually. It then reads each individual line and calculates the information this line tells. It will then output the desired stats.   
To run the program open the command line to the folder containing both programs and the log files. Run the command 'python cat_shelter_program.py LOGFILE'  
  
  
## 3. Task 3: Managing Passwords  
  
 - Deluser Program 
This works as intended, from the command line running the program deluser.py followed with the file containing the passwords. It will ask for the Username that is required for deletion, the program will delete that line by selecting the rest of the data into a list and then writing this new list to the file. 
 - Add User program 
 This program works as intended, from the command line the file containing the passwords can be entered and the program will ask for input of a Username, full name and password. This will be added to the password document, with the password encrypted Using the ROT-13 algorithm.
 https://blog.finxter.com/how-to-use-rot13-in-python/ - I did Use this blog for the Use of ROT-13 within my program. 
 -Login Program
 This works as intended, from the command line with an argument of the file containing the Username and password. It will ask for a new Username and password and will then convert the password to a ROT-13 Value. If the Username is in the file and the password value matches this, it will display that the login was successful. 
 - Passwd Program
 This works as intended, from the command line with an argument of the file containing the Username and password. It will ask for the current Username and password which it will confirm against the file. It will then ask for a new password and a confirmation which it will write into the password file specified.
