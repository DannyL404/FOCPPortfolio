# Task 1 to do 

### Calculate a pizza program for Beckett Pizza Plaza BPP

Prerequisites
•	All pizzas cost £12
•	Tuesdays – 50% off everything 
•	All orders have a £2.50 delivery cost – collection is free 
•	If ordered via the BPP app there is 25% off – applied after the Tuesday discount 

Program outputs 
•	Show the order details (what pizzas and quantities)
•	If it requires delivery 
•	Show the cost (in pounds and pence – 2dp)

The program needs to be able to handle erroneous input by reasking for data.

Can ask day of week no need to use the system clock
